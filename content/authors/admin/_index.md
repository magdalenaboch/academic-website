I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the [Cognitive Neuroecology Lab](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~xpsy0353/) at the University of Oxford and collaborating closely with the [Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Unit](https://scan-psy.univie.ac.at/) at the University of Vienna.

# In my research, I use comparative functional neuroimaging to study a potential convergent evolution of the neural bases supporting social abilities in humans and dogs. I #also combine multiple neuroimaging modalities to investigate the evolution, structure, and function of the temporal lobe — a key brain area for social cognition in #primates— across a broad range of carnivoran species.
