abstract: Dogs and humans have lived together for thousands of years and share many
analogous socio-cognitive skills. Dog neuroimaging now provides insight into the
neural bases of these shared social abilities. Here, we summarize key findings from
dog fMRI identifying neocortical brain areas implicated in face, body, and emotion
perception and action observation in dogs. These findings provide converging
evidence that the temporal cortex plays a significant role in visual social cognition in
dogs. We further briefly review investigations into the neural bases of the dog-human
relationship, mainly involving limbic brain regions. We then discuss current challenges
in the field, such as statistical power and lack of common template spaces, and how
to overcome them. Finally, we argue that the foundation has now been built to
investigate the neural bases of more complex socio-cognitive phenomena shared by
dogs and humans. This will help establish the domestic dog as an even more powerful
comparative model species and provide novel insights into the evolutionary roots of
social cognition.
