abstract: Empathic abilities are increasingly shown to be modulated by interpersonal and contextual factors. However, causal evidence regarding self-other distinction abilities in empathy, as measured by egocentric and altercentric biases, is virtually non-existent. This study aimed to demonstrate how malleable such biases are by investigating the impact of two priming manipulations. Prior to completion of an affective touch task, Experiment 1 primed a secure, avoidant, or anxious attachment style, whereas Experiment 2 primed a similarities or dissimilarities focus. We predicted that, unlike affect sharing, self-other distinction benefits from interpersonal distance primed by avoidant attachment and dissimilarities focus. Experiment 1 revealed a modulation of the altercentric bias; the extent the other person’s feelings biased self-perspective judgments was significantly lower in the avoidant attachment group than in the secure and anxious attachment groups. Experiment 2 demonstrated that egocentric bias – the extent to which first-hand experienced emotion biases judgments of another person’s emotion – was significantly lower in the group primed with a similarities focus. These findings suggest that self-other distinction abilities in empathy are modulated by interpersonal and contextual factors, but in ways that differ from affect sharing (in Experiment 1), and non-affective self-other distinction (in Experiment 2).
