title: Workshop - How to become a Post-doc
summary: I co-organized a 2-day workshop surrounding the topic “How to become a Post-doc” targeted at PhD candidates in their final year at the University of Vienna and the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. My PhD buddy Hoi-Lam Jim and I had the idea, developed the concept and outline of the workshop, organized the speakers (principal investigators and post-docs) and moderated the workshop.
