title: PostDoc Award of the Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna
summary: In 2022, I received the PostDoc award for the project “Connecting brain structure and function in dog and human neuroimaging” in collaboration with Rogier Mars at the University of Oxford. This award was in support of my independent research at the University of Oxford and the development of my own research line. It allowed me to establish a first common framework of comparison across carnivoran brains based on neocortical sulcal anatomy (published in eLife) and laid the foundation for further ongoing projects with the overarching goal of creating a common space of comparison between the carnivoran and primate brain based on structural and functional brain organization by combining a range neuroimaging modalities.
