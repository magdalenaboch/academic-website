title: Marietta Blau fellowship, Austria’s Agency for Education and Internationalisation (9,480€)
summary: This predoctoral fellowship (2021–2022) supported my first research stay at the University of Oxford, facilitating the establishment of a long-term international collaboration with Rogier Mars. During this period, we developed methods to analyze canine resting-state fMRI data, enabling the comparison of connectivity profiles in social brain areas between dogs and humans.

In 2022, I received the PostDoc award for the project “Connecting brain structure and function in dog and human neuroimaging” in collaboration with Rogier Mars at the University of Oxford. This award was in support of my independent research at the University of Oxford and the development of my own research line. It allowed me to establish a first common framework of comparison across carnivoran brains based on neocortical sulcal anatomy (published in eLife) and laid the foundation for further ongoing projects with the overarching goal of creating a common space of comparison between the carnivoran and primate brain based on structural and functional brain organization by combining a range neuroimaging modalities.
