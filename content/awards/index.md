#title: Action observation
summary: My research focuses on understanding brain diversity, driven by the central question of what makes us social. Through a comparative framework, I aim to uncover the fundamental principles underlying the neural mechanisms of social behaviour across diverse mammalian species while also investigating the factors that drive differences in brain organization. I study this by entirely non-invasive comparative research with humans, dogs and other carnivoran species, with the ultimate goal of expanding this framework to a wide range of mammalian species and lineages.
