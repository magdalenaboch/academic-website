Over the last years, colleagues from the SCAN Unit and I organized and hosted an interactive workshop at the annual Children's University in Vienna. Under the title "What does our brain do? - Everything about the brain and the abilities it enables us to have" we teach pre-school and elementary school children about brain structure and function focusing on empathy, perspective taking and memory. We explore for example how the human brain looks like by making brain hats together and  compare it to the brains of other animals in a match the animal and brain quiz. We also put our brains to the test with memory tasks and try to imagine what it actually feels like to be old in a role-playing game.
