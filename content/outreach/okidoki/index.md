title: Does my dog understand me? 
summary: In 2023, I participated in a two-part SciComm segment for the children's TV program [Hallo OKIDOKI](https://okidoki.orf.at/) on ORF 1 (main Austrian TV channel), where I explain awake dog neuroimaging research and the insights gained so far into how dogs and humans perceive and understand each other. The segment introduced the world of dog social cognition and neuroimaging to a young audience (ages 0 to 10)
