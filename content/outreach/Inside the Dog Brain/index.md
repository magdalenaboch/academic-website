title: Inside the Dog Brain with Guide Dogs UK.
summary: In fall 2022, I have been invited from the [Centre for the Creative Brain](https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/discover/research/centre-for-the-creative-brain-2) at the University of Oxford to talk about my research joining speakers from Guide Dogs UK at a public engagement event. I explained why pet dogs are an exciting model species for comparative social neuroscience and the research questions I am interested in my work. Followed by an introduction of the dog brain and how we collect the dogs neuroimaging data. Finally I discussed some highlights from awake dog fMRI research so far covering insights into dog and human brain evolution as well as the dog-human relationship.
